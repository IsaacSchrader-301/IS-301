Marine Sedimentary Soils
200 million years ago the Pacific
Ocean reached to Idaho, and Oregon
was entirely underwater. Marine
sedimentary soils were developed
from the sandstone and shale on the
ocean floor.
Includes Willakenzie, Melbourne,
Goodin, Wellsdale, Bellpine and
Dupee soil series
Volcanic Soils
Multiple fissures around the
Washington/Oregon/Idaho border
created one of the largest volcanic
events on Earth between 17 and 6
million years ago. Lava flows traveled
throughout northern Oregon into
the Willamette Valley and created
basalt bedrock.
Includes Jory and Nekia soil series
Loess Soils
The Ice Age created a combination
of weathered soil composed of rock
ground down by glaciers. Between
100,000-50,000 years ago, this
weathered soil was fed into the
streams and then blown onto the
hillsides, especially at the northern
end of the Willamette Valley.
Includes Laurelwood soil series
